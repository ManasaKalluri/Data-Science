1. Implementing TFIDF Vectorizer

This project implements custom TFIDF vectorizer on collection of text documents and comparing its results with Sklearn implementation. Final output has been L2 normalised and given in sparse matrix representation. Extension of this project has modified fit and transform functions which considers top 50 idf scores features and tfidf vectorizer has been implemented.



2. Implementing RandomSearchCV with k fold cross validation on KNN

Implementing Random search CV on randomly generated binary class 10000 data point classification. Performance metric considered here is accuracy score.
